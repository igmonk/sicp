;; Exercise 3.23
;;
;; A deque ("double-ended queue") is a sequence in which items
;; can be inserted and deleted at either the front or the rear.
;;
;; Operations on deques are:
;; - the constructor make-deque
;; - the predicate empty-deque?
;; - selectors front-deque and rear-deque
;; - mutators front-insert-deque!, rear-insert-deque!,
;;            front-delete-deque!, rear-delete-deque!
;;
;; Show how to represent deques using pairs
;; and give implementations of the operations.
;;
;; Be careful not to make the interpreter try to print a structure
;; that contains cycles. 
;;
;; All operations should be accomplished in Î¸(1) steps.
