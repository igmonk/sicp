;; Exercise 3.78
;;
;; Consider the problem of designing a signal-processing system
;; to study the homogeneous second-order linear differential equation
;;
;; d^2 * y        dy
;; -------  - a * -- - by = 0
;; d * t^2        dt
;;
;; The output stream, modeling y, is generated by a network that
;; contains a loop.
;;
;; This is because the value of d^2 * y / d * t^2 depends upon
;; the values of y and dy/dt and both of these are determined by
;; integrating d^2 * y / d * t^2.
;;
;; The diagram we would like to encode is shown in figure 3.35.
;;
;; Write a procedure solve-2nd that takes as arguments the constants
;; a, b, and dt and the initial values y0 and dy0 for y and dy/dt and
;; generates the stream of successive values of y.
